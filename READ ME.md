# Assets for BUSMALL Lab


Marketing Research:
    Our marketing research team wants this website created as a way to survey the popularity of each product and how much customers are interested buying them.


Developement:
    Upon the request of the marketing research team, the development team works to create this website. When the user clicks on each product image, the computer keeps track of the number of clicks as an indication of the user's interest. 


Focus Group Participant:
    We will share this website with the customers. The participation is encouraged but not required. Upon completing each survey, they will receive a small gift.
